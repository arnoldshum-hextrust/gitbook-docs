# Rate Limits

At Hexsafe, our objective is to ensure that we're delivering a platform that is robust, reliable, but also secure for all our users. We understand the critical importance of stability in your operations, and that's why we've put in place comprehensive network traffic monitoring systems. These systems meticulously analyze the traffic from all users, helping us identify and promptly address any patterns that could potentially impact the network adversely.

In our continuous commitment to safeguard the integrity of our platform, we've implemented rate limits to monitor and control traffic. If an account generates traffic volumes that exceed these limits, we may need to apply temporary restrictions to ensure the overall stability of the service for all users. Please note that these rate limits are established on a per-API-endpoint and per-minute basis, providing a balanced distribution of network resources.

## API Rate Limit: Decoding Error Messages

In the event that you exceed the rate limit, our system will respond with a HTTP 429 status error. This is simply our friendly way of letting you know that youâ€™ve momentarily surpassed the allowable limit, and it is advisable to pause requests for a short while.\\

We understand that every user's needs are unique, and there may be times when you require a higher rate limit. Should you find yourself in such a situation, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Hexsafe customer support team. We're always here to listen and find possible solutions to support your needs.

Requests for increasing rate limits will be thoroughly reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and approval is not automatic or guaranteed. In some instances, higher limits may necessitate additional charges, but rest assured, we'll always keep you informed and discuss the best possible options with you.\
